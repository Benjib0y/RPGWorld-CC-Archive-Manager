# RPGWorld-CC-Archive-Manager
A small application to manage Character Creator databases in RPGWorldPGWorld General discussion forums and I'll explain.
Once the program and support file are installed, run CCArchiveManager.
On first run it will create an empty archive database and present a list of the CC's in your CC database.
Use the arrow keys to move CC's between the two lists. NB You can use shift+click and CTRL+click to move multiple CCs ata time.
Use the Sort buttons to sort the entries alphabetically.
N.B. CC's are Moved between lists - not copied.
When you are happy with your arrangement click Save to write your new CC database and create your archive. Both files will be backed up before the rewrite, so if things go wrong you can delete the new files and rename the backups.
Any feedback, please leave a message on the RPGWorld Steam forum in the RPGWorld Toys thread.
